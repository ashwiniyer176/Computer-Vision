# Computer-Vision

## Projects
1. **Handwritten Digit Classification:** Classification of handwritten digits (the MNIST dataset), a very beginner friendly project in Computer Vision.
2. **CIFAR10 Classification:** Classification of RGB images with classes such as bird, cat, horse, ship, automobile etc. 
3. **Filtering:** Experimenting with various filters used to noise and denoise an image.
4. **Facial Recognition:** Facial Recognition from various angles using Siamese Networks and One Shot Learning
5. **Alzheimer's Detection:** Using brain scans to detect Alzheimer's in patients. 
6. **Fish Species Classification:** Using images of fishes taken from A Large Scale Fish Dataset, to classify fishes.
7. **CIFAR10 with Hyperas:** Automated hyperparameter tuning using Keras on CIFAR10.
8. **Next Frame Prediction:** Predicting the next frame based on the object's trajectory using CNN-LSTM.
